Hi, 
this folder is to practice GIT and understand how this version control tool work using terminal in this case is git bash
- using git status will list all the untracked files(not yet in the staging area) in the working directory
- use "git add chapter1.txt" 
    - to add this file to the staging area
- use " git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE" "to commit changes
- use " git log " to list the commits
